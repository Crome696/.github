# 🌟 Welcome to My Digital Realm! 🌟

I'm a developer based in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, currently working for a financial services provider 
with a mission to restore financial freedom.

**About Me**

My journey into coding began with a love for video games. Faced with the challenge of competing against players using automation software, I decided to learn these skills myself. What started as a way to level the playing field turned into a passion for problem-solving and ultimately led to my professional career in development.

**What I Do**

- 💻 Develop solutions that empower financial freedom
- 🧩 Approach coding as an exciting puzzle-solving exercise
- 🌱 Continuously learn and adapt to new technologies

**Outside of Coding**

When I'm not immersed in code, you'll find me:
- 🐕 Spending time with family and friends, especially our grumpy senior dog Sam (a 15-year-old Terrier Mix)
- 🎲 Enjoying board games and video games
- 🌍 Traveling to events and meetups
- 🏞️ Exploring nature as a member of the Association of Hikers
- 🎵 Singing with my local Choral Society
- 🌾 Supporting rural traditions through the Countryman's Association

### 📚 Description 📚

MediaMultiVerse is a closed-source application designed to crawl and
archive various types of media from different websites. It remains uncertain whether the project will transition
to an organizational structure and permit external contributions. More or less this is my deep dive into Angular 18.

<h1 align="center">Client-API</h1>

### 📚 Description 📚

Client-API is a .NET-based library designed to control external applications on Windows using the Windows API (WinAPI).
Its primary purpose is to enable the creation of automated workflows for games and applications distributed through 
mobile markets. The framework consists of two main components:
- Client-API: A library containing all the necessary functions to interact with target applications.
- Client-Tools: A configuration tool that includes features such as a code generator, image validator, and encryption 
capabilities.

This project serves as a research initiative to explore WinAPI and learn how to interact with mobile games using 
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. Key features and aspects of the Client-API framework include:

- Windows API Integration: The library leverages WinAPI to manipulate and control external applications running 
on Windows.
- Automation Capabilities: It allows users to create automated workflows for games and mobile applications, potentially 
streamlining repetitive tasks or enabling bot-like functionality.
- OCR Implementation: The framework incorporates OCR technology to read and interpret text and visual elements from 
target applications, facilitating interaction based on screen content.
- Code Generation: The Client-Tools component includes a code generator, which likely assists in creating boilerplate 
code or scripts for specific automation tasks.
- Image Validation: The framework provides tools for validating images, which could be useful for ensuring the accuracy 
of OCR results or for comparing screen elements during automation.


As a research project, Client-API serves as a platform for exploring WinAPI functionality and developing 
skills in application automation and interaction.

> It's important to note that while this framework provides powerful capabilities for automating and controlling 
> external applications, users should be aware of potential legal and ethical considerations when interacting 
> with third-party software, especially in the context of games and mobile applications.

### 📚 Description 📚

[ScriptSDK](https://github.com/scriptsdk) is an implementation of external script-api for [Stealth-Client](https://stealth.od.ua/).


Stealth-Client is a specialized game client developed in Delphi for [Ultima Online](https://uo.com). 
This custom client enhances gameplay by enabling automation of various in-game tasks and processes through integrated 
scripting languages, including Pascal Script and Python. 

The creation of ScriptSDK was influenced by numerous community contributors and served as an educational project to 
explore the implementation of time-sensitive operations via an exposed API.

### 📚 Description 📚

[RebirthUO](https://github.com/RebirthUO) was an Ultima Online free shard based on [ServUO](https://www.servuo.com/).

Many years ago, RebirthUO was a Ultima Online freeshard operated by a team including Tecmo, Ruaduck, and Crome696. 
The server offered a customized gameplay experience, utilizing various features from RunUO and ServUO. 

RebirthUO provided players with unique features and benefits, including specialized newbie armor, 
skill and stat bonuses, and house placement options.
Although the freeshard ceased operations around 2017, some of the individuals involved in its management 
have maintained a presence in the Ultima Online emulation community. 

### 👀 Where to get a copy? 👀

The server itself is closed source but tools and goodies for the scene 
might be released [here](https://github.com/RebirthUO).

### ⌛ History ⌛

- 2016 - 2017 Runnable service hosted and maintained through the team.
